Hey there! Thanks for visiting my Git Repo.

This is a quick demo of applying some of the stuff I learned from LinkedIn Learning; JavaScript Essentials Training.

First things first, to design this guy I made a quick mockup on figma:
https://www.figma.com/file/AJJ2MwtALrW8bZRinon4YG/Burp-Counter?node-id=0%3A1

I used javascript to move names from the entry field onto the first line, and other event listners to active the burp sound when someone clicks on the button.

I also added a small easter egg for anyone who is able to get past 10 burps.

Then I used JS to reset the entire webpage using the button at the bottom, simple and sweet.

Found the sound samples here: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/burping-161
Used Mozilla Developer Network, W3 and Stackoverflow for assistance and came out with a reasonable product.

Thanks for taking the time to look at my stupid creation, hope you enjoy it.
